# MarkovJunior-docs
[MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) is a probabilistic programming language where programs are combinations of rewrite rules and inference is performed via constraint propagation, developed by Maxim Gumin. This fork adds documentation and a few explanatory comments, which may be useful to others reading the code.
