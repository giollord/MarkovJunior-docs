[MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) is a probabilistic programming language where programs are combinations of rewrite rules and inference is performed via constraint propagation, developed by Maxim Gumin.
This fork is based on fork [MarkovJunior-docs](https://github.com/kaya3/MarkovJunior-docs) by Andrew Kay which adds documentation and a few explanatory comments, which may be useful to others reading the code.

This fork contains Unity-compatible library which can be built as DLL and referenced in Unity project.
